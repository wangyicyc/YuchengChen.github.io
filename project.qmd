## Actor-Critic Algorithm + MPC Controller for UAV Autonomous Flight
**Project Leader**｜ 2026.02 – 2026.06
**Project Description:**
Combined reinforcement learning with model predictive control to achieve agile flight control for UAVs. Integrated Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm with MPC controller, using reinforcement learning to handle decision-making in complex environments while using MPC to ensure control stability and safety. Implemented a control framework based on differentiable optimization, allowing MPC's optimization process to be incorporated into reinforcement learning training.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- PyTorch
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- MPC (Model Predictive Control)
- Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic)

![Kalman Filter](images/KalmanFilter.png)
**Project Description:**
Outdoor environment: UAV carrying a 1.5L mineral water bottle autonomously flew on an 8m*80m runway, performing the following tasks:
1. UAV autonomously took off from the designated takeoff point
2. Searched for white barrels for delivery in an 8*5m area 30m away from the takeoff point, with three white barrels (diameters: 30, 20, 15 cm) - smaller diameter barrels scored higher
3. Reconnoitered dangerous objects in an 8*5 area 65m away from the takeoff point and remotely transmitted data for team members to fill in at the console
4. After completing the above tasks, UAV autonomously returned to the takeoff point and landed

**Technologies Used:**
- C++
- Fuzzy PID Control
- VFH Path Planning
- Kalman Filtering

**Project Description:**
Indoor environment: UAV carrying 3×100g express boxes performed tasks in a 10×10m area, with the following specific tasks:
1. Autonomously took off from the takeoff point
2. Searched for 5 existing targets in a 10×8.5m area for delivery, with delivery scores calculated based on delivery accuracy and target weights, while avoiding dense obstacles in the area
3. After completing task 2, proceeded to the entrance of a 10×1.5m corridor, traversed the corridor to reach the landing point for accurate landing, with two 80cm-wide narrow passages in the corridor

**Technologies Used:**
