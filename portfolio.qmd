### Multi-UAV Connected Coverage Search
**Project Description:**
Deployed distributed multi-UAVs for cooperative search in an information map, aligning UAV trajectories with information distribution to acquire more information. Implemented frequency domain-based coverage search algorithm and ensured multi-UAV connectivity through probability-based path planning.

**Technologies Used:**
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- iLQR Trajectory Optimization
- Python/C++
- Gazebo Simulation
