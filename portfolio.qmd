### Multi-UAV Connected Coverage Search

![Multi-UAV System](https://trae-api-cn.mchost.guru/api/ide/v1/text_to_image?prompt=Multiple%20drones%20flying%20in%20coordinated%20formation%20over%20a%20landscape%2C%20high%20quality%2C%20realistic%20rendering&image_size=landscape_16_9)

**Project Description:**
Deployed distributed multi-UAVs for cooperative search in an information map, aligning UAV trajectories with information distribution to acquire more information. Implemented frequency domain-based coverage search algorithm and ensured multi-UAV connectivity through probability-based path planning.

**Technologies Used:**
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- iLQR Trajectory Optimization
- Python/C++
- Gazebo Simulation

### Wind-Disturbed UAV Target Search & Delivery

![UAV Delivery System](https://trae-api-cn.mchost.guru/api/ide/v1/text_to_image?prompt=Drone%20carrying%20package%20flying%20in%20windy%20conditions%2C%20searching%20for%20target%20landing%20zone%2C%20high%20quality%2C%20realistic%20rendering&image_size=landscape_16_9)

**Project Description:**
Outdoor environment: Load-carrying UAV autonomously flew and searched for target white barrels in an 8×5m area, delivered payloads, and returned to base for landing. Implemented fuzzy PID controller for wind disturbance rejection.

**Technologies Used:**
- C++
- Fuzzy PID Control
- VFH Path Planning
- Kalman Filtering

### Obstacle Forest Express Delivery UAV

![Obstacle Avoidance Drone](https://trae-api-cn.mchost.guru/api/ide/v1/text_to_image?prompt=Drone%20flying%20through%20indoor%20environment%20with%20obstacles%2C%20carrying%20small%20packages%2C%20high%20quality%2C%20realistic%20rendering&image_size=landscape_16_9)

**Project Description:**
Indoor environment: Load-carrying UAV (3×100g express boxes) performed tasks in a 10×10m area: searched for 5 targets, delivered packages, and avoided dense obstacles. Deployed FAST-LIO for localization and Ego-Planner for path planning.

**Technologies Used:**
- ROS
- FAST-LIO
- Ego-Planner
- MPC Controller
- C++
