## Project Experience

### Multi-UAV Connected Coverage Search  
**Project Leader**｜2025.09 – Present  
- Deployed distributed multi-UAVs for cooperative search in an information map, aligning UAV trajectories with information distribution to acquire more information.  
- **Key Contributions**：  
  1. **Coverage Search**: Implemented frequency domain-based UAV coverage search algorithm to improve coverage efficiency in information-dense areas.  
  2. **Multi-UAV Connectivity**: Introduced connectivity probability as a cost term into the path planner to ensure multi-UAV communication and cooperation.  
  3. Used **iLQR** for trajectory optimization. 

### Wind-Disturbed UAV Target Search and Delivery  
**Project Leader**｜2024.07 – 2024.10  
- Outdoor environment: Load-carrying UAV autonomously flew and searched for target white barrels in an 8×5m area, delivered payloads, and returned to base for landing.  
- **Key Contributions**：  
  1. **Fuzzy PID Controller (C++)**: Implemented fuzzy rules to adaptively adjust PID coefficients for precise control under wind disturbances.  
  2. **Path Planning Algorithm VFH**: Solved current feasible points and generated smooth paths through B-spline curve optimization.  
  3. **Filter Algorithm Deployment**: Combined Kalman filter and low-pass filter to remove noise and smooth controller output. 

### Obstacle Forest Express Delivery UAV  
**Project Leader**｜2023.10 – 2024.05  
- Indoor environment: Load-carrying UAV (3×100g express boxes) performed tasks in a 10×10m area: searched for 5 targets, delivered packages, and avoided dense obstacles.  
- **Key Contributions**：  
  1. **ROS-based Flight Code (C++)**: Implemented obstacle avoidance and delivery tasks in obstacle forest and narrow corridor environments.  
  2. **Localization and Path Generation**: Deployed FAST-LIO and Ego-Planner for high-precision localization and obstacle avoidance path planning.  
  3. **MPC Controller (C++)**: Computed control inputs online based on target points and constraints to achieve high-precision tracking of global paths. 

### 3rd University Intelligent Robot Creativity Competition - UAV Group A Competition  
**Participant**｜2024.08 – 2024.11  
- Participated in the UAV Group A Competition, focusing on autonomous flight tasks with obstacle avoidance and target recognition.  
- **Key Contributions**：  
  1. **Autonomous Flight Control**: Developed robust flight control algorithms for UAVs in dynamic environments.  
  2. **Obstacle Avoidance System**: Implemented real-time obstacle detection and avoidance using sensor fusion.  
  3. **Target Recognition**: Integrated computer vision systems for target detection and identification.
